### What is Synchronous in JavaScript?

- As its base JavaScript language is synchronous. Synchronous means the code runs in a particular sequence of instructions given in the program. Each instruction waits for the previous instruction to complete its execution.

# What is synchronous and asynchronous in JS?

- Explained: Asynchronous vs. Synchronous Programming
  The differences between asynchronous and synchronous include: Async is multi-thread, which means operations or programs can run in parallel. Sync is single-thread, so only one operation or program will run at a time. Async is non-blocking, which means it will send multiple requests to a server.
  

  
# Asynchronicity

- Means that if JavaScript has to wait for an operation to complete, it will execute the rest of the code while waiting. Note that JavaScript is single-threaded. This means that it carries out asynchronous operations via the callback queue and event loop.

- In JavaScript, asynchronous operations utilize callbacks to further process the responses they receive from Web APIs.

### Callback

- To achieve this, you need to use an asynchronous function to request external data and pass it a callback function as a parameter.


### Promises

- Inside an async function, you can use the await keyword before a call to a function that returns a promise.
- A promise may have one of three states
  • Pending
  • Fulfilled
  • Rejected
